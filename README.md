## Docs

[Please see the docs library in the wiki.](https://bitbucket.org/arcann/bi_etl/wiki/Home)

Note: However, that the formatting in the Wiki is not as nice as what Sphinx generates in HTML. Presently the best way to use the docs is to clone the repository and open ./docs/build/html/index.html in the browser of your choice.
