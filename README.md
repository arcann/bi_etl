## Docs

[Please see the docs library in the wiki.](https://bitbucket.org/arcann/bi_etl/wiki/Home)

Note: However, that the formatting in the Wiki is not as nice as what Sphinx generates in HTML. Presently the best way to use the docs is to:
 
1. Clone the repository
2. Run ./docs/make html 
3. Open ./docs/build/html/index.html in the browser of your choice.
