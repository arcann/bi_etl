# bi_etl Python ETL Framework for BI

## Docs

[Please see the docs library.](https://bitbucket.org/arcann/bi_etl/src/master/docs/source/index.rst?at=master&fileviewer=file-view-default)

Note: However, that bitbucket doesn't process the RST files the same way that [Sphyx](http://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/1.5.1/index.html) does. Presently the best way to use the docs is to clone the repository and open ./docs/build/html/index.html in the browser of your choice.
